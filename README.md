> Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing

> All the time
My baby, you're on my mind
And I don't know why
Yeah, but the feeling is fine
Can't you see
Yeah, honey you are for me, oh
We were meant to be
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight
